Adversarial Attack Strategies<br>
Graph Neural Network fior Dependency Analysis<br>
Self Healing and Auto Remediation<br>
Decentralized Privacy Techniques<br>
Predictive Security Analysis<br>

Futue Ideas
## Quantum Safe Cryptography Integration

# Objectives
a. Collect training and test data from research papers, cwe, masvs, chatgpt and other sources<br>
b. To integrate open-source tools and create a common playground for them.<br>
c. Test mobile applications in semi-automatic manner.<br>
d. Use comprehensive AI learning methods using NLP and other techniques.<br>
