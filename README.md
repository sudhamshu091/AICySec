b. DRL Based Dynamic Anaysis<br>
c. Adversarial Attack Strategies<br>
d. Graph Neural Network for Dependency Analysis<br>
e. Self Healing and Auto Remediation<br>
f. Decentralized Privacy Techniques<br>
g. Predictive Security Analysis<br>
h. Broader and Generalized Attack Vectors<br>
Future Ideas<br>
a. Quantum Safe Cryptography Integration

# Roadmap
