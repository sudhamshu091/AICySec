a. AI Enabled Code Analysis and Mutation<br>
b. DRL Based Dynamic Anaysis<br>
c. Adversarial Attack Strategies<br>
d. Graph Neural Network for Dependency Analysis<br>
e. Self Healing and Auto Remediation<br>
f. Decentralized Privacy Techniques<br>
g. Predictive Security Analysis<br>
h. Broader and Generalized Attack Vectors<br>
Future Ideas<br>
a. Quantum Safe Cryptography Integration

# Roadmap
Dataset collection and preparing a training dataset 2 months(Start from January 2023)
<b>3 week/strategy(Individually implement the ideas using ai)</b>
Research existing code analysis strategies.
Implement basic and advanced code analysis functionalities
Develop Mutation Starategies based on analysis(reverse engineering)
Integration various tools during dynamic analysis.
interatively improve strategies based on testing outcomes
